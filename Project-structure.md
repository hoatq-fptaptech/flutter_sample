# Project architecture (Clean Architecture Approach)

### 1. Why:
    * We want to separate what type of database that we use for storage (might want to change it
      later on)
    * To adhere SOLID principles since we are using OOP for this project.
    * Ensuring UI layers don't know what is going on at data layer at all.
    * Might want to separate each layers into different packages.
### 2. Presentation - Domain - Data.
### 3. Presentation layer consist of
    * Widgets
    * BLoC
        * Bloc only manages UI state based on business logic
### 4. Domain layer (Business logic layer)
    * Repositories (interfaces aka idea how the logic would behave)
    * Entities (or models which what UI needs)
    * Usecases (user stories)
        * Typically one function, but can be more if they are functionality related.
        * Remember, one class for one responsibility.
### 5. Data layer
    * Data Sources
        * remotes (API)
        * locals (Database)
    * Models
        * request
        * response
    * Repositories (Implementation from Domain layer)
### 6. More insight of layers

### 7. The inner layer should **NOT** know what the outer layer has / do.
